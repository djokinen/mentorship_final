	<h1>What Is A Mentee?</h1>
	<div class="text5">
		<p>YOU! The Cree Youth are referred to as <span class="text4">Mentees</span> within this mentor program. A mentee is a person who is advised and counselled by a mentor who is a Cree member or friends of the Cree. These <span class="text4"><a href="/mentor.aspx">Mentors</a></span> are industry leaders with expertise in their field of work.</p>

		<p>The concept is that a mentee will have the role of driving the relationship between you and your mentor, developing a plan, resourcing information, and making a commitment to continuous learning throughout this process. </p>
		<p>Mentees have the benefit of different mentors within different industries in regards to gaining exposure to a variety of styles, opinions, and experiences.</p>
