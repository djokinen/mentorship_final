	<h1>What Is A Mentor?</h1>
	<div class="text5">
		<p><span class="text4">Mentors</span> are industry leader who will guide and support their <span class="text4"><a href="/mentee.aspx">Mentees</a></span> based on their personal work experiences. Mentors can, among other things, provide exceptional learning experiences for their mentees and, in doing so, expand their mentees' awareness, insight and perspective.</p>
		<p>A mentoring relationship is very important to a Mentee. As a Mentor, you need to get to know your Mentee and learn about their hopes and dreams, so you can help them in a way that meets their personal best interest. A mentoring relationship can be richly rewarding, not only for the person being mentored, but as well for the Mentor.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="text1">Share your experiences and insights</div>
	<div class="text5">
		<p>In doing so, choose stories that you feel are appropriate and helpful to your mentee. Be open to sharing your mistakes and failures as this is where the biggest lessons are learned.</p>
		<p>This will also help your Mentee become aware of the fact that challenges inevitably arise; the way you dealt with the situation may help them gain insight about how to build resilience.</p>

	<h1>How do I get involved?</h1>
	<!--<div class="text1">How do I get involved?</div>-->
	<div class="grid_16">
		<ul class="list">
			<li>As a Mentor, you will complete the registration form which requests information -your academic, career, and personal interests.</li>
			<li>In addition, you can indicate the type of services you are able to provide.</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<div class="text5">
			<p>Please note that all advice and professional information that is communicated between yourself and your mentee is solely a recommendation, and every Cree Youth should feel free to make their own decisions and career choices. This network is about guiding and sharing insights.</p>
			<p>Mentoring is a symbiotic relationship between a mentor and a mentee. Not only does the process advance the personal and professional development of the mentee, but it can also enhance the career satisfaction of the mentor.</p>
